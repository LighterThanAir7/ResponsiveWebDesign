Nutrition labels have a lot of bold text to draw attention to important information. Rather than targeting each element that needs to be bold, it is more efficient to use a class to apply the bold styling to every element.

The float property is used to place an element on the left or right of its container, allowing other content (such as text) to wrap around it.

<p class="bold">Serving size <span class="right">2/3 cup (55g)</span></p>

!!!!! The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.

Typography is often more art than science. You may have to tweak things like alignment until it looks correct. Give your .calories-info span selector a margin-top set to -7px. This will shift your 230 text into place.

Give the .divider selector a clear property set to right. This will clear the float property, pushing the divider and any following content down below the float text.

The clear CSS  property sets whether an element must be moved below (cleared) floating  elements that precede it. The clear property applies to floating and non-floating elements.
When applied to non-floating blocks, it moves the border edge  of the element down until it is below the margin edge  of all relevant floats. The non-floated block's top margin collapses.

Essentialy, pomiče taj element skroz dolje
Is a keyword indicating that the element is moved down to clear past right floats.

The :not pseudo-selector can be used to select all elements that do not match the given CSS rule.

div:not(#example) {
  color: red;
}
The above selects all div elements without an id of example.

Modify your .daily-value p selector to exclude the .no-divider elements.

.daily-value p:not(.no-divider) {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #888989;
}
